    <h1>Was Roger Right: What&#39;s Up, Doc? (1972)</h1>
</div>
<div>
    
    <h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>I love Roger Ebert. I don't know enough about film criticism for it to mean anything to say that he is my favorite film critic, but it stands nonetheless. He is sometimes criticized for being too soft on movies, for "liking everything." Well, a few responses:</p><ol><li>"Liking everything" is pretty weak, as far as supposed flaws go. The Dalai Lama "likes everything".</li><li>It's <a href='http://amzn.to/21lJya6'>definitely</a>&nbsp;<a href='http://amzn.to/21lJyHd'>not</a>&nbsp;<a href='http://amzn.to/1UjY1TN'>true</a> about Roger Ebert.</li><li>What <em>is</em> true is that Roger always <em>tried</em> to find something to like in every movie he saw; he would judge the movie on its own terms and report honestly on how he though it measured. He usually could find something to like and he was usually right.</li></ol><p><strong>Usually.</strong></p><p>But not always.</p><p>So what I would like to explore in a series of film reviews is whether I agree with Roger's review of some movie I've recently seen and felt strongly about. I don't always mean to find movies we disagree on, but I also will try to emphasize where he and I differ. Anyway, without further ado I present the first installment:</p><h2><a name="<strong>was&#95;roger&#95;right</strong>&#95;about&#95;'<em>what's&#95;up,&#95;doc?</em>'"></a><strong>Was Roger Right</strong> about '<em>What's Up, Doc?</em>'</h2><p><p> <span class="marginnote"><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w396/x1rkdx7qQKC8lTqlM7EwkmDSXd8.jpg"> <em>What's Up, Doc?</em> (1972), Directed by Peter Bogdanovich. Starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal</span>  <a href='http://amzn.to/1QLvFjY'><em>What's Up, Doc?</em></a> is film school brat Peter Bogdanovich's second film, the (superficially) less ambitious follow-up to his seminal directorial debut, <em>The Last Picture Show</em>. Both films are (as would prove to be the hallmark of Bogdanovich's whole career) steeped in nostalgia - and deep knowledge of - classical Hollywood cinema. I've never seen <em>The Last Picture Show</em> - just <em>Paper Moon</em>, before this - but this film demonstrates a familiarity with golden-era Hollywood comedy that rivals Mel Brooks at his best (i.e. <em>Young Franktenstein</em>). </p></p><p>I was extremely taken with this film. Billed as a romantic comedy, it delivers on both promises: it is terribly funny - sometimes extremely clever, sometimes rauckus, sometimes wacky, but only rarely stale or predictable; and it is a sweet love story.</p><p>There is a great deal to be said on this second aspect. It is, I think, pretty well understood that romantic comedies with female protagonists are structurally different from those with male protagonists. When a woman stars, she generally has to juggle the affections of multiple suitors and eventually choose between them; when a man stars, he usually has to persist in courting a reluctant woman. I've always thought it would be fun to try a male-structured comedy with a female star, and in fact that is just what this movie is. It's actually quite interesting: it has so much in common with '30s and '40s studio pictures, but its plot is the fundamentally modern story of a woman who <em>wants</em> to be with a man - and gets him!</p><p>Barbra Streisand really does steal the show in that regard. It takes a remarkably charming woman to make us forget (or forgive) that she is trying to sabotage Ryan O'Neal's (admittedly sham of an) engagement - but she does it and then some. The audience is rooting for Streisand's character from the very beginning. She is captivating in every scene, which seems to justify the havoc that she causes.</p><p>I said earlier this was <em>superficially</em> less ambitious, because although it is, as Ebert notes, a "screwball comedy utterly lacking in redeeming social importance," it demanded a meticulous attention to detail - something that comes through in the camera work, the set design, the screenplay, and the wardrobe.</p><p>But enough about me. <a href='http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/whats-up-doc-1972'>What does Roger think</a>?</p><blockquote><p>[Bogdanovich] directs with the slapdash economy of the 1930s comedies. "What's Up, Doc?" is only about 90 minutes long, takes no time for sloppy romantic scenes, and remembers to be funny even when Miss Streisand is singing (she reclines on top of the piano, natch). </p></blockquote><p>I disagree somewhat here - although the piano scene is somewhat funny, it is also nonsensical, sloppy, <em>and</em> romantic (they sing "As Time Goes By", which gets me every time). However, overall he is right about the sense of economy - I am shocked to learn that the movie was only 90 minutes. It felt far more substantial.</p><blockquote><p> [Streisand] proves herself as our most accomplished screen comedienne. </p></blockquote><p>This is bonkers. Streisand's character is charismatic, quirky, and alluring, but a laff riot she is not. Not only does the early '70s have enough funny leading ladies to go around - on TV, Mary Tyler Moore, Lily Tomlin, and Carol Burnett for starters - but you don't have to look any further than this film to find a comic genius. <em>What's Up, Doc?</em> is actually the big-screen debut of Madeline Kahn (remember, <em>Young Frankenstein</em>?). She plays O'Neal's demanding and ambitious fiancee, and if Streisand's character is the more lovable, Kahn's is the juicier role.</p><blockquote><p> The chase scene (Barbra and Ryan aboard a grocery delivery wagon inside a Chinese dragon, being chased downhill by three cars) is as nice as anything in this line in a long time. <br /></p></blockquote><p>This is true - and, indeed, for a long time to come. This chase scene goes unmatched until at <em>least</em> 1980's <em>The Blues Brothers</em>, and several times during this extended climax I thought it had even that famous sequence bested.</p><p>It seems I did not choose a good Ebert review for my first installment - he had little to say about the film at all, let alone something to agree with or not. But we soldier on.</p><h2><a name="in&#95;conclusion"></a>In Conclusion</h2><p><strong>My Score</strong>: 5/5</p><p><strong>Roger's Score</strong>: 3/4</p><p><strong>Was Roger Right?</strong> He liked the movie, but his review is short and he never revisited in any of his <em>Great Movies</em> books. I don't think he liked it <em>enough</em>, although I suspect if he knew how few movies Bogdanovich was going to come out with he would have paid it a little more mind.</p>
