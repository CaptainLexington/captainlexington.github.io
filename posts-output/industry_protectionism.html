</div>

    <p>Conservatives, as a rule, don't like welfare; liberals, as a rule, tend to support welfare programs. This election season we have two candidates who, if not actual manifestations of those two archtypes, are the parodies the other sides see each other as. Donald Trump actually has a pretty reasonable policy on welface, supporting expanding <a href='http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Donald&#95;Trump&#95;Welfare&#95;+&#95;Poverty.htm'>welfare-to-work and job training programs</a>. Bernie Sanders, of course—well, the <a href='https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-and-wealth-inequality/'>only entitlement reform he mentions on his "Wealth and Income Inequality Page"</a> is better funding for Social Security. So maybe neither of these candidates is the stereotype of their party on welfare.</p><p>At least, not openly. But both candidates support a welfare program called "<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism'>protectionism</a>". Trump and Sanders both believe the American economy suffers because manufacturing jobs have been exported to countries like China and Japan.</p><p>From Trump's page on <a href='https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/us-china-trade-reform'>US-China Trade Relations Reform</a>:<blockquote><p>At its heart, this plan is a negotiating strategy to bring fairness to our trade with China. The results will be huge for American businesses and workers. Jobs and factories will stop moving offshore and instead stay here at home. The economy will boom. The steps outlined in this plan will make that a reality.  </p></blockquote></p><p>From Bernie Sanders's page on (previously linked) on <a href='https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-and-wealth-inequality/'>Income Inequality</a>:<blockquote><p>4. Reversing trade policies like NAFTA, CAFTA, and PNTR with China that have driven down wages and caused the loss of millions of jobs. If corporate America wants us to buy their products they need to manufacture those products in this country, not in China or other low-wage countries.  </p></blockquote></p><p>Just so that we're absolutely clear, their argument is this: developing nations having lower wages, and thus can provide manufacturing services at lower prices than manufacturing concerns in the US; corporations, seeking to lower costs and increase profits, move their manufacturing overseas and drive Americans out of work. This is bad for the economy.</p><p>Everything until that last sentence is true. That last sentence is also <em>kind of</em> true, but not in the way they think.<label for="sn-kindoftrue" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-kindoftrue" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">It is true that when a class of people don't have money to consume, that is a problem for the economy. Protectionism is not the best solution for this.</span> </p><p>Now, there is no shortage of criticisms of protectionism: </p><ul><li>Protectionism raises the cost of goods produced domestically, which raises the cost of living for consumers.</li><li>Protectionism raises the cost of doing business for corporations, which slows economic growth.</li><li>Protectionism stalls the economy by favoring low-wage industrial jobs over knowledge work.</li><li>Protectionism preserves the jobs of working-class people in developed nations, but it <a href='http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the&#95;dismal&#95;science/1997/03/in&#95;praise&#95;of&#95;cheap&#95;labor.html'>takes employment from the desperately poor in third-world countries</a>. (Although this is the most persuasive argument to me, and my preferred for deployment against liberals, who often claim to care about poverty, <a href='http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/23/the-price-of-glee-in-china/'>it is not without its philosophically humorous complications</a>).</li><li>Protectionism creates a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight&#95;loss'>deadweight loss</a> in the industries it "protects", which harms all actors in the economy.</li></ul><p>We're going to focus on this last criticism—because in the end, I'm not going to try to defeat protectionism in this post, just expose it for it what it is: a welfare program.</p><p><a href='http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/'>Slate Star Codex again</a>:<blockquote><p>[I]f your job can be done more cheaply without you, and the only reason you have it is because people would feel sorry for you if you didn’t, so the government forces your company to keep you on – well then, it’s not a job. It’s a welfare program that requires you to work 9 to 5 before seeing your welfare check.  </p></blockquote></p><p>The author's point in saying this is that if society has decided that it is willing to give you money because it feels sorry for you, it might as well not make you pretend to work for 40 hours just to give you your check. "But wait!" you say, "There's a big difference between sitting around all day doing nothing and working a job! If you have a job you are <em>contributing to the economy</em>!"</p><p>Sorry, you're not. That's where the deadweight loss comes in. If you a company could save $40,000 a year by moving your job to Mexico, but the government regulates Mexican imports to prevent that from happening, you know where that $40,000 goes? It goes nowhere. You've sucked it up. It might not trouble you too much that your employer doesn't get that $40,000, but that's not the full story. That $40,000 gets passed along to the consumers of whatever it is your job produces. If you were on welfare and the government gave you $40,000 for no reason, your welfare check would come out of the pocket of every taxpayer. If you work for a company that makes store-brand plastic brooms for Wal-mart, and you only have a job because the government makes it expensive or illegal to make those brooms overseas, your paycheck comes out of the pocket of Wal-mart customers. You know, poor people. Your job is actually a <em>drain</em> on the economy.</p><p>If you only have a job because the government is protecting your industry from competition overseas or from automation, <em>you don't contribute to the economy</em>. Your job is a pointless ritual you must perform before they give you a check. If that's what you support because you prefer the dignity of work, very well. But don't lie to yourself that you're helping the economy.</p>
